This project is a pathfinding visualizer that will implement many pathfinding algorithms.

The app will be built using React, HTML, JavaScript, and SCSS. 

The Algorithms that will be implemented will include:

1. Djikstra's Algorithm

2. A* Algorithm

3. DFS(For Fun)

and many others. 

The design goal is to make the visualizer perform well by making state updates efficient and elegant.

The design will be organized in such a way that adding additional features such as more algorithms will be easy.
